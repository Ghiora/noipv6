1) StandAlone/rust-alookup has a program that in src/main.rs will return the dns addresses for a URL.
	It uses the library https://github.com/stbuehler/rust-alookup
	The MIT License


2) I use the local-ip-address library for getting the local  
   IP address, both ipv4 and ipv6 of your system.

	It and was written by: Esteban Borai 
	I got it here: 
		https://github.com/EstebanBorai/local-ip-address
		It has an MIT and Apache license.

2.1) StandAlone/ipv6_addr_as_func an example of using it.

	In src/main.rs I pass it the network interface:
		const INTERFACE: &str = "enx7898e81e3d5d";
	The ipv6_addr_as_func returns only the first latest global ipv6 address.
	As much as I can tell on Ubuntu it is the latest (aka newest).
	I did not test it on other systems. MY guess it will work on any linux.

	Running:
		./ipv6_addr_as_func/target/debug/ipv6_addr
	Results in:
		Latest ipv6 from interface: 2a0d:6fc2:5310:4c00::e93


3) StandAlone/get_nat_ip has a program that calls a function 
   get_my_nat_ip_address in src/main.rs which returns the nat address 
   of the machine it is running on by doing a get to:

		http://ip1.dynupdate.no-ip.com (the same results you get if you use this URL in your browser)

You can see all stand alone programs above running by:
# Assuming you have cargo and rust installed
cd StandAlone
# This will compile all of the stand alones and run them.

./all.sh

Get the ips for my computer by using dns 
The ipv4 returns the nat, both the ipv4 and ipv6 should match those below!!
If not it is time to update the dynamic dns in https://www.noip.com
176.231.163.229
2a0d:6cf2:5310:4c00::e93



Get my ipv4 from the http://ip1.dynupdate.no-ip.com 
This is the IPV4 address SEEN from the outside my network because of nat!!
Got text "176.231.163.229"



Get the latest ipv6 from the interface 
It should be the same as the one from dns below!!

Latest ipv6 from interface: 2a0d:6fc2:5310:4c00::e93

Copy the changes I made to the stand alone code!!
